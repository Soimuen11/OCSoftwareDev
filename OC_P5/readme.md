This is my project 5 on the front-end developer path at openclassrooms. I had to create 2 quotations generators. 

The first one simply builds a quote by assembling various elements of a sentence (subject + verb + complement)

The second generator is a tad more complex as it assembles parts of a sentence, although it resembles the first one quite much. The most significant difference is that you can select the number of quotes you want the generator to create.
